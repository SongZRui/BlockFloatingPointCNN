# BlockFloatingPointCNN
This is the original code of paper "Computation Error Analysis of Block Floating Point Arithmetic Oriented Convolution Neural Network Accelerator Design"
This work is based on [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe). The function "caffe_cpu_gemm" is replaced to simulate the behavior of block floating point(BFP) on CPUs.
